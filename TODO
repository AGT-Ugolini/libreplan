--------------------

Dates
~~~~~

* *Feature freeze*: 2010w50
* *Release date*: 2011w1

Main features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Multiproject management. It offers a global vision of the company managing
  several projects sharing resources.
* Group resource allocations: dynamic groups based on criteria.
* Flexible calendars.
* Configurable Gantt chart from Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS) chart.
* Overload resource allocation control.
* Earned Value Management (EVM).
* Cost analysis based on work reports.
* Integration with other *NavalPlan* instances and third-parties.
* Other functionalities: materials, quality forms, project templates, planning
  scenarios, multiple task progress measurement ...

Latest features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Backwards planning with new restrictions (AS_LATE_AS_POSSIBLE and
  FINISH_NOT_LATER_THAN).
* Two direction resource allocation schemes. Forwards and backwards strategies
  supported depending on Gantt conditions.
* Time unit inferior to hours in calendars. Minutes and seconds are allowed.
* Limiting resources. Appropriative insertion algorithm with task scrolling.
* Monte Carlo technique for project duration simulation. Duration probability
  functions are calculated based on likelihood estimations.
* Sigmoid advance resource allocation function approaching what happens in real
  world.
* Monitorization of project progress based on critical path progresses.
* Human readable codes generation for data.
* Configurable display of advances and cost in planning tasks.
* Database migration support. Automatic management of database refactorings
  keeping former data.


Version 1.1 - 2011w14
---------------------

Dates
~~~~~

* *IRC coordination meeting*: 2011w2
* *Feature freeze*: 2011w11
* *Release date*: 2011w14

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Improve printing support.
* Possibility of using critical chain paradigm in project planning.
* Resource levelling.
* General allocation resource allocation improvements: reduction of
  fragmentation in distributing allocation algorithm and heuristic to use same
  resources over a period.
* Performance improvements: resource load view and Gantt view.
* Chromium browser completely supported.


Future
------

* Disable complex features by default.
* Quick start wizard.
* Add export/import for different format files from other projects like
  OpenProj, MicrosoftProject, ...
* Provide examples for integration services that don't depend on Ruby (maybe
  directly with Java).
* Migrate to ZK 5.


Wish List
---------

* Customization (e.g. recently opened projects in menu).
* Database snapshot with example data.
* Unit tests for integration services using truly HTTP requests and XML files.
* Auto-deployable executable. Application is downloaded and installed with JNLP
  (Java Web Start) and on starting launches an embedded servlet container in
  which it is executed. It will include a pure Java database like HSQLDB too.

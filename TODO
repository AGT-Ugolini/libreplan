Future
------

* Disable complex features by default.
* Quick start wizard.

  directly with Java).
* Migrate to ZK 5.


Wish List
---------

* Customization (e.g. recently opened projects in menu).
* Database snapshot with example data.
* Unit tests for integration services using truly HTTP requests and XML files.
* Auto-deployable executable. Application is downloaded and installed with JNLP
  (Java Web Start) and on starting launches an embedded servlet container in
  which it is executed. It will include a pure Java database like HSQLDB too.

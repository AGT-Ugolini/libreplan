    Example:
    - get-xml-schema.sh criteriontypes

  * [Optional] For clarity: remove "navaldev" database + reload Jetty.

  * Import criterion types:

    - import-criterions-types.sh criterion-types-sample.xml
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

    - Check the returned errors are consistent with the comments in
      criterion-types-sample.xml.

    - Repeat with criterion-types-update-sample.xml (for updating some
      criterion types).

  * Export criterion types:

    - export-criterion-types.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Import label types:

    - import-label-types.sh label-sample.xml
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

    - Check the returned errors are consistent with the comments in
      label-sample.xml.

  * Export label types:

    - export-label-types.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Import type of work hours:

    - import-type-work-hours.sh type-work-hours-sample.xml
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

  * Export type of work hours:

    - export-type-work-hours.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Import resources:

    - import-resources.sh resources-sample-mini.xml (or resources-sample.xml)
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

    - Check the returned errors are consistent with the comments in
      resources-sample.xml.

    - Repeat with resources-update-sample.xml (resources-sample-mini.xml
      must be previously imported).

  * Export order elements:

    - export-order-element.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Import orders:

    - import-order-elements.sh order-elements-sample.xml (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

  * Export resources hours:

    - export-resources-hours.sh 2010-01-01 2010-12-31 (authenticate with
      wsreader/wsreader)

    - export-resources-hours.sh 21654685 2010-01-01 2010-12-31 (authenticate
      with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Export calendar exception types:

    - export-calendar-exception-types.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

+ When working with the online demo add "--prod" argument to every command.
Example:

  * import-criterions-types.sh --prod criterion-types-sample.xml
    (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

  * Import criterion types:

    - import-criterions-types.sh criterion-types-sample.xml
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

    - Check the returned errors are consistent with the comments in
      criterion-types-sample.xml.

  * Export criterion types:

    - export-criterion-types.sh (authenticate with wsreader/wsreader)

  * Import resources:

    - import-resources.sh resources-sample-mini.xml (or resources-sample.xml)
      (authenticate with wswriter/wswriter)

    - Check the returned errors are consistent with the comments in

  * Export resources hours:

    - export-resources-hours.sh 2010-01-01 2010-12-31 (authenticate with

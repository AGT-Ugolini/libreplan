 NavalPlan is a planning tool for users based on some concepts: company and
 multi-project overview, criteria assignments, tasks tagging, resources
 management, resource allocation (specific and generic), company load control,
 external integration, etc.

 Although its name is clearly related to shipbuilding, NavalPlan is a fully
 useful planning tool for any type of company whose workflow requires project
 and order administration and scheduling.

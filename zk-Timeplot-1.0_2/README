This is a custom version of zk-Timpelot-1.0_2. The original version
can be downloaded here: http://www.zkoss.org/download/zktimeplot.dsp

If you do further changes call deploy.sh. It will install the
generated jar in your maven local repository. Then you should be able
to run the application and see the changes. Once you are happy with
your changes you should move this jar to a public repository.

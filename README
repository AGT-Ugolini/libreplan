LibrePlan Audiovisual
=====================


Description
-----------

LibrePlan Audiovisual is a sectorial adaptation of LibrePlan oriented to the
management of the costs forecast and execution during the development of
audiovisual productions.

Its main goal is to cover all the stages related with budget definition,
planning and monitoring, from the tracking of the costs point of view. It allows
to track the execution of the budgeted items compared with the real expenses and
providing an overview of the real costs compared with the forecasts together
with the productivity measures obtained.


Specific features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Budget templates system

  Create new projects from configurable template trees with the budget structure
  and predefined data.

  Start with complete budget template based on the ICAA model which comes with
  the application

* Budget execution forecast

  Visualize and modify the distribution along time of the cost of the budget
  items, and compare the real costs to do the neccesary adjustments.

* Advanced assignment of forecasts and cost details

  Distribute in a fine grained detail level the expenses forecast.

  Use the cost sheets to track the produced expenses during the project.

  Integrate the costs system with other tools to import expenses through Web
  Services

* Filming productivities perspective

  Measure the productivities on the ellaboration of the multimedia product being
  developed, according to different unit types (scenes, minutes or script
  pages).

  Define an initial filming plan, specifying the estimated productivities,
  compare them with the real measurements and adapt the forecasts.

* Planning and expenses Reports

  Generate printable reports either on PDF or HTML showing information on the
  project execution.

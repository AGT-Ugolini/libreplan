NavalPlan
=========


Description
-----------

*NavalPlan* is a planning tool for users based on some concepts: company and
multi-project overview, criteria assignments, tasks tagging, resources
management, resource allocation (specific and generic) company load control,
external integration, etc.

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Company and multi-project overview.
* Criteria management: Criteria are a system entity that enables resources
  (both humans and machines) and tasks to be classified.
* Resources management: There are two different kinds: humans and machines.
* Resource allocation: One of the key points of the program is having the
  possibility of two kinds of designation: specific and generic. Generic
  allocation is based on criteria that are required to carry out a task and
  must be fulfilled by resources that are capable of performing them.
* Calendars: Calendars determine the available productive hours for different
  resources. The user may create general calendars for the company or input
  characteristics for more specific calendars, meaning that calendars for
  resources and tasks can be made.
* Labels: These are elements that are used to label project tasks. With these
  labels, the user of the program can group tasks together according to
  concept, which can then be checked at a later date as a group or after being
  filtered.
* Orders and order elements: Work requested by clients is treated by the
  application as an order, which is structured in order elements. The order and
  its elements adhere to a hierarchical structure of undefined levels. This
  element tree is the basis when planning work.

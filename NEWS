Version 1.1.0 (19 May 2011)
---------------------------

New major version of NavalPlan. Apart from a lot of bugfixing the main features
included in this version are:

* Fixed problem with WebKit based browsers.

  Now WebKit based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Epiphany) and last version of
  Firefox are fully supported.

* Fixed issues in printing.

  Printing uses a WebKit based solution and thus failed occasionally because of
  the previous issue that is fixed now.

* Over allocation control support.

  In 1.0 version it was not possible to configure a limit of overtime for
  workers. From now on users can configure calendars with this feature. You can
  set a maximum overtime in each regular work week day or in a specific
  exception day.

  This provides a lot of flexibility in the resource allocation strategies. You
  can do allocations without generating overtime or generating a controlled
  amount of it. In this way, users can ask the application to calculate the
  soonest finish date for a task taking into account the overtime allowed.

  A last clarification about this control is that is done per task. The maximum
  allocation assigned to a worker is observed per task. This means that if you
  have two tasks in the same period assigned to the same resource, taking into
  both tasks, you can surpass the overtime constraint.

* Hierarchical criteria enforced.

  Criteria in NavalPlan are like dynamic roles that resources can satisfy and
  can be hierarchical. This means that one general criterion can include other
  more specific criteria inside. For instance, it is possible to configure the
  general criterion Engineer with two children like Electric Engineer and
  Software Engineer.

  This feature was disabled in version 1.0.4 and is provided again after some
  fixes were done.

* New generic allocation algorithm.

  Generic allocation is the assignment based on criteria. You specify the set
  of criteria which must be satisfied by the workers who are able to do the
  task and, after this, NavalPlan looks for them and selects the ones less
  loaded to be planned.

  The algorithm which selects the workers to be assigned to a task when
  generic allocation is used was improved in several points:

  * The sharing hours process allocates workers when selected up to load 100%.
  * On selecting workers for a date inside a task, the new algorithm tries to
    use the workers assigned in the previous days of the task. In this way, the
    algorithm is not based just in load but selects first the previously used
    resources if they have free hours.

* Project scheduling window new features.

  In the project scheduling window four improvements were done:

  * Positioning system on zoom changes. Now when the user changes the zoom
    level in the Gantt planning window, after the screen has been refreshed
    the scroll is moved so the user will see the same time period.
  * Calendar exception days are shown in the Gantt planning grid with a
    different background color. At day and week zoom level the project
    calendar is used to highlight the non-working days.
  * Violated dependencies are highlighted. A red color is used to draw
    dependencies that are violated.
  * Resource load chart precision was improved. Now two points per time unit
    are represented and this makes the chart more accurate in the resource load
    chart which is displayed in the bottom of Project Planning view, Project
    scheduling window, company resource usage screen and project resource usage
    screen.

* Default password change notification protocol.

  It was implemented a mechanism to control if the password for the default
  users have been changed. Default accounts which are provided are:

  * admin/admin. This user is the user with administration privileges.
  * user/user. This is a common user without administration privileges.
  * wswriter/wswriter. This user has write permissions to use then web
    services operations which require modify or insert data in NavalPlan.
  * wsreader/wsreader. This user has read permissions to the use web services
    operations which only require read permissions.

  The mechanism consists of showing warning messages in the left bottom corner
  of the screen remembering which default user accounts have still configured
  the default password.

* Minute accuracy in calendars and allocation windows.

  In 1.0 version calendars are expressed in hours the same as the amount of
  allocated time in tasks. This means that users cannot use minutes if they
  want to have a higher detail level in the plans.

  This was changed and now is possible to specify the calendars and the
  allocations in hours and minutes. In the allocation screens this is done
  with the ":" separator in the input boxes.

  A thing which is pending to be implemented is to allow estimate the WBS for
  a project in hours and minutes. In 1.1 is only allowed in hours.

* Limiting resources new insertion algorithm.

  It was implemented a new algorithm for inserting tasks in points where there
  are already tasks planned in the limiting resources. The new algorithm moves
  the tasks respecting better the order of the tasks already planned.

* Calendar interface revamp

  User interface for calendars was improved to provide an easier use.

* WBS screen

  This window was tested deeply and errors related to moving nodes in the tree
  were corrected.

Notes
~~~~~

If you are upgrading from any 1.0.x verion, you will need to manually execute on
your database the SQL sentences from file:
``/usr/share/dbconfig-common/data/navalplan/upgrade/pgsql/1.1.0``

To get database access information review ``/etc/tomcat6/context.xml`` file.
